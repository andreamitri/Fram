Project Description

FRAM is a responsive web application that showcases a local food delivery service connecting customers with nearby partner farms. The project demonstrates modern frontend web development practices, including responsive layout design, client-side state management, interactive UI components, map integration, and an AI-inspired chatbot.

The website includes:

An AI-inspired chatbot that assists users with common questions

The project was developed as part of an AI Integrated Web Development course and focuses on frontend implementation, usability, and ethical AI considerations.

Features Overview
